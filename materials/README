This directory contains files containing material specific
information.  All files related to the same material will
be named with the same prefix.  For example, files related
to Tantalum might be named "Ta.c11.dat", "Ta.c12.dat", etc.


File Types:
-----------

  <prefix>.c11.dat
  <prefix>.c12.dat
  <prefix>.c44.dat

        These files contain the values for material specific
        isothermal elastic constants through a range of temperature
        and pressure values.  Temperatures are in degrees K, pressures
        and constant values are in units of Mbar.  The format of each
        of these files is:

            <temp1> <pressure1> <const value>
            <temp1> <pressure2> <const value>
            ...
            <temp1> <pressureN> <const value>
            <temp2> <pressure1> <const value>
            <temp2> <pressure2> <const value>
            ...
            <tempM> <pressureN> <const value>

        Additionally, blank lines or lines beginning with "#" 
        are ignored as is anything following the pertinent values
        on a valid data line.

    
  <prefix>.burg.dat

        This file contains values for the atomic volume per atom through
        a range of temperature and pressure values.  This is used for
        calculating the proper value for the burgers vector magnitude.
        Temperatures are in degrees K, pressures are in units of Mbar and
        the volume constants are in units of cubic Bohrs. The format of
        this file is the same as the format for the elastic constants
        files (i.e. *.c11.dat, *.c12.dat, ...) described above.


  <prefix>.meltTemp

        These files contain values for the melting temperature of the
        specified material through a range of pressures.  Temperatures
        are specified in degrees K and pressures in units of MBars. The
        format of these files is:

            <temp1> <pressure1>
            <temp2> <pressure2>
            ...
            <tempN> <pressureN>

        Additionally, blank lines or lines beginning with "#" 
        are ignored as is anything following the pertinent values
        on a valid data line.

  <prefix>.mobility

        These files contain the values for the material specific
        pieirls, deltah_0, and alpha values (needed in the functions
        for calculating non-linear velocity) through a range of pressure
        and temperature values.  Pressures are in units of GPa and
        temperatures are in degrees K.  The format of each of these
        files is:

        <pressure1> <temp1> <deltaH_0> <pieirls> <alpha>
        <pressure2> <temp1> <deltaH_0> <pieirls> <alpha>
        ...
        <pressureN> <temp1> <deltaH_0> <pieirls> <alpha>
        <pressure1> <temp2> <deltaH_0> <pieirls> <alpha>
        <pressure2> <temp2> <deltaH_0> <pieirls> <alpha>
        ...
        <pressureN> <tempM> <deltaH_0> <pieirls> <alpha>
