#
# Data for an precipitate consists of the following items separated with white space
#
# Precipitate ID     : 1 integer identifying the precipitate regardless of its position in the simulation or the domain encompassing it. (Should be sequential values)
# Position           : 3 values specifying the XYZ coordinates of the center of the precipitate
# Semi-principal axes: 3 values defining the three semi-principal axis of the ellipsoidal precipitate in units of b
# Rotation matrix    : 2 vectors defining the rotation of the ellipsoidal precipitates
# Strain field       : 6 components of the strain field for the particleStrain field is a symmetric matrix so only six components are specified
