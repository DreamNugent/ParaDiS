#  This is an example control file for an 8 processor simulation of
#  an FCC Copper crystal using anisotropic elasticity.  This requires
#  that the ParaDiS code has been compiled with ansiotropy support
#  (See the section of the ParaDiS User's Guide on "Compiling with
#  Anisotropic Forces").
#
#  This examples uses the FMM correction table fm-ctab.Cu.Aniso.m2.t5.dat.
#  If this correctiontable has not been provided in the "inputs" 
#  directory, see the section of the ParaDiS User's Guide on 'ctablegen'
#  for generating the correction table.
#
#  Output generated by this example will be placed under the directory
#  specified by the <dirname> value below and includes:

#      Restart files
#      Various properties files (i.e. desity, stress/strain, etc)
