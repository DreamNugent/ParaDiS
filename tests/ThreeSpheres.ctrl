#
#  This example inserts eshelby inclusions into the simulation and
#  enables use of a mobility function which retards the mobility of
#  any dislcoation segments that intersects inclusions
#
#  Various types of outputs are generated and placed under the
#  directory specified by the <dirname> value.

#  Specifying a file which defines the inclusions to be inserted
#  automatically enables the code that calculates forces from
#  inclusions on dislocations

inclusionFile = "tests/ThreeSpheres.dat"
#
#  Enable the inclusion-specific FMM code to calculate forces from
#  remote inclusions.  If this is not enabled, dislocations will
#  only experience effects from inclusions in the 27-cell cube
#  surrounding the dislocation.
