#
# Sample file defining Eshelby inclusions to be inserted into
# a ParaDiS simulation.
#
# Data for an inclusion consist of the following items separated
# by white space
#
#     Inclusion ID:  Unique integer identifying the inclusion regardless
#                    of its position in the simulation or the domain
#                    encompassing it.  (Should be sequential values)
#     Position:      3 values specifying the X, Y and Z coordinates of
#                    the center of the inclusion
#     Radius:        Radius of the inclusion in units of b
#     Strain field:  Strain field for the particle.  Strain field is a
#                    symetric matrix so only six components are specified
#                    in the order: S[0][0], S[1][1], S[2][2], S[1][2],
#                    S[0][2], S[0][1]
